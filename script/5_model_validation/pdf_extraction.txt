Explanations of Coliform Analysis:
If coliform bacteria are Absent, the water is considered safe for drinking purpose. If coliform bacteria are Present, the water is considered unsafe for
drinking purpose. Presence of E. coli (bacteria) generally indicates that the water has been contaminated with fecal material. It must be remembered that a
water analysis refers only to the sample received and should not be regarded as a complete report on the water supply.
